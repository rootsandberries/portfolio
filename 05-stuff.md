### and it's all everybody else's fault!

I'm Santa Claus! I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

### Oh, I always feared he might run off like this.

Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?
Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!
Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.

I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

Bender, you risked your life to save me! Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!

Then we'll go with that data file! I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Soon enough.

Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Shinier than yours, meatbag. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.

Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! You lived before you met me?! Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?

Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Daylight and everything. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?

Wow, you got that off the Internet? We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!

I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!

WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Hey, whatcha watching? We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.
